# cordova-plugin-geolocation-android-activator
Simple complement for geolocation plugins, like apache's cordova-plugin-geolocation, that asks the user to activate the GPS.


## To use
Just call it.
```js
navigator.geolocation.activator.askActivation();
```

If the GPS is not activated and the app has location permission, the user will be asked to accept it's activation, like the images below.
